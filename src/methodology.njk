    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">The Whiffs methodology is my attempt at implementing ideas from Tom Tango on how to best evaluate projection systems.</p>

    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">Here are a few important posts I'm drawing from:</p>

    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      Based on these posts, Whiffs uses four key principles:
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-12 mb-8 leading-10">Separate playing time from rate stats</h2>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      Consider a player projected for 300 PA and 30 HR who actually gets 600 PA with 30 HR. Was that a good HR projection?
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      If you only look at raw HR totals, the projection appears perfect.
      But it actually got luckyâ€”vastly underestimating playing time while overestimating power, with the errors canceling out.
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      <strong class="font-semibold">Whiffs evaluates playing time separately from rate stats to prevent this misleading assessment.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      Playing time is measured by <strong class="font-semibold">plate appearances</strong> for batters and <strong class="font-semibold">batters faced</strong> for pitchers.
      All other stats are evaluated as rates using the most appropriate denominator for each type of statistic.
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      For example, strikeouts and walks are evaluated per plate appearance or batter faced, while batted ball outcomes are evaluated per ball in play.
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      This approach aims to evaluate each stat within its most meaningful context.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-12 mb-8 leading-10">Adjust for league average</h2>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      Here's an example based on <a href="https://www.insidethebook.com/ee/index.php/site/article/testing_the_2007_2010_forecasting_systems_official_results/" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">one from Tom Tango</a>:
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      One system projects .340 wOBA for a player in a .330 league. Another projects .330 wOBA in a .330 league.
      The player ends up with .338 wOBA in a .338 league. Which projection was more accurate?
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      The player turned out to be league average, so the second projection is more useful to us, even though it was further from the raw number.
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      <strong class="font-semibold">Whiffs subtracts a projection's league average of a rate stat before calculating error.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      In this example, the projected league-adjusted wOBAs would be +.010 and .000, respectively.
      The second projection better predicted the actual league-adjusted wOBA (also .000).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-12 mb-8 leading-10">Weight by playing time</h2>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      A projection error for a 100 PA player matters less than the same error for a 600 PA player.
      Projection systems shouldn't be penalized equally for mistakes on marginal versus regular players.
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      <strong class="font-semibold">Whiffs weights each error by the player's actual PA or BF to reflect real-world impact.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-12 mb-8 leading-10">Include unprojected players at league average</h2>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      If you only include players projected by every system, you're really limiting yourself to the easiest players to project.
      We want to reward systems that attempt harder projections.
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 text-lg leading-8">
      <strong class="font-semibold">If a player is missing from a projection system, Whiffs assigns them 250 PA/BF with league average rates.</strong>
